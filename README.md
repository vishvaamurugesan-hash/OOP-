The project titled “Campus Green Zone Finder” focuses on developing a digital system that identifies, analyzes, and visualizes green spaces within a university or institutional campus. With the increasing importance of sustainable development and environmental well-being, higher education institutions are striving to create eco-friendly campuses that promote biodiversity, reduce carbon footprints, and enhance the overall quality of student life. This project aims to support these goals by providing a technological tool to locate and evaluate existing green zones and identify potential areas for further greening initiatives.

The proposed system integrates Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing techniques with real-time environmental data to map and assess vegetation-rich areas. Using satellite imagery, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis, and sensor-based environmental data such as air quality and temperature, the system categorizes zones based on their ecological value, accessibility, and sustainability potential. By employing spatial analysis and image processing methods, the “Campus Green Zone Finder” can accurately distinguish between built-up areas, open grounds, and vegetated zones.

The project also seeks to enhance campus planning and environmental management by providing actionable insights to administrators, landscape designers, and sustainability officers. It will allow users to visualize the green density of different campus sections through an interactive interface or map-based application. Furthermore, the system can be extended to include features such as pollution monitoring, tree health assessment, and the identification of optimal areas for planting new vegetation.

Ultimately, this project contributes to the development of smart, sustainable, and green campuses, encouraging environmental awareness and data-driven decision-making. By integrating technology and ecology, the Campus Green Zone Finder serves as a practical solution to promote greener and more livable academic environments.
